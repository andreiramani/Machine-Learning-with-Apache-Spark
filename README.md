## Course 12 from 13 (Part of IBM Data Engineering Professional Certificate by Coursera)
<p></p>
<p>Collection of all hands-on and final project for course 12 - "Machine Learning with Apache Spark". Since Skills Network Lab upgraded, the virtual lab experience is flawless. Unfortunately, maybe there is some misclassification correct answer on 'Final Project Evaluation' because I can get 100% correct answer on evaluation.</p>
<p>Probable misclassification correct answer are:
<ul>What is the coefficient for Frequency?</ul>
<ul>What is the coefficient for AngleOfAttack?</ul>
<ul>What is the coefficient for ChordLength?</ul>
<ul>What is the coefficient for FreeStreamVelocity?</ul>
<ul>What is the coefficient for SuctionSideDisplacement?</ul>
</p>
<p>Any discussion are welcome....</p>
